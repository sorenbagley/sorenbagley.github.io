    For the past decade, Bagleyâ€™s work has increasingly focused on creative portraiture, ranging widely across subjects but united by a distinctive style that is derived from his unique concern with lighting and composition. His interests lie in the human form and the way it can be used as an expression of something resembling love. Whether with his studio work or candid work, his images are always reaching out into the deeply personal in the hopeof retrieving something universal.  </p>

A visual artist of many different hats, Bagley also co-founded the advertising agency Hawkesbury Media Group which produces commercial content for a variety of businesses in the Midwest. Hawkesbury Media Group has produced content for such high-profile clients as Prestige Portraits, Buckeye Cable Network, and the Republican National Committee.  Bagley is currently employed as an in-house photographer for Woodard Photographic where he works to capture a wide variety of candids for major events in his home city of Toledo, OH.
